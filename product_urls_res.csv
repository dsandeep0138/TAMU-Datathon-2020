It features an ergonomic slim handle design for balance and speed. The frictionless smooth rotation of this speed skipping rope ensures faster spins so that you can burn more fat. For incredible cardio workouts, this item is the right choice. It is small and lightweight enough for you to take with you to the park, beach, while on vacation and more. This Athletic Works jump rope helps increase your agility, coordination, and endurance, while maintaining good health. It is ideal for boxers, MMA fighters and other types of athletes and weekend warriors. For the money, five stars. Not to be confused with something that might cost you 100 bucks. But it is adjustable, provided you know what length you are comfortable with. Once you cut it, you cannot redo it. So, measure twice and cut once (or go in increments). Pull the excess thru from the handle end with pliers, and use scissors or a wire cutter. Vinyl rope will last long. Light-weight, good for cardio. Only bought this recently, so I don't know how well the entire construction of the handle and rope will last. But for under 7 bucks, it's a great investment in fitness gear. It is missing a handle. So it is totally useless"

This ab roller features dual traction control wheels for increased stability and has soft, foam-grip handles that mold to your hands. It's easy to use for beginners and professionals. wanted to try something new. heads up though, if you aren't experienced in working out and with strong abdominal muscles, then this probably isn't for you. after putting it together, there are too much free space between the handles so the wheel wobbles a lot.  i had to put a spacer in between the wheels to use it.   should get it from the store so you can inspect it first."

Has lasted us about three years and we haven't had to refill any air. Its a little lower now than it was initally but it serves its purpose. We use it to sit on inbetween reps and it has survived my barbarian 300lb husband for the three years that we've had it. This was a god send when I was pregnant and i want one for work now. This is terrible. I bought this one and half month ago.. My 10 year old was doing his routine exercise and guess what!! the ball bursted. It could not even survive 80 lb load? We have used so many balls so far but never saw or heard one bursting. They claim it's made out of so called 'anti-burst material'. Total lie. 
Do not buy this.."

I bought these for our camping trips. We got caught in the rain once and they are pretty much ruined.  They are for outside use so they should be sealed.  I'm very disappointed.

Teammates stand on opposite sides of the playing area and work together to score points by tossing and/or catching the balls. Three points for a shot directly in the net. One point if your teammate catches the ball on a fly after bouncing off of the ramp. If the shooter's toss comes up short and hits the front of the ramp, the ball will bounce back in the shooter's direction. The opposing team member can now come in and catch the ball to gain an extra shot for their team. The first team to 15 wins!   <div class=""review-text""><p>We LOVE this game!

No Tools or Stakes Required Ultra portable and nearly instant, the Zume Games Badminton Set is up in seconds. Its freestanding base design sets up on any surface and doesn't require tools or stakes. Plus, the carrying case makes it easy to take with you anywhere. This set also includes 2 red rackets, 2 green rackets, and 2 shuttlecocks. Pro:  Very innovative!  Great for setting up anywhere.  Moves with ease and our family had a great time using it.
Pro:  Extremely fast delivery.  
Pro:  'Designed' to be a self-contained storage unit.
Pro:  Everyone agreed that the rackets were exceptional!   
Pro:  The net is well made and the shuttle cocks arrived perfectly formed!
Con:  The orange arms do not align themselves with the holes within the bore inside the box (see pics) and we were lucky to get one to click into place.  Once strenuously forced to fit the distorted position of the holes - the orange arms cannot be removed ever again.  . . .and boy we tried!  The rest of the arms deployed easily.
Con:  As the orange arms are fully extended so that the net can be set in place; the inner most (largest diameter telescoping) arm starts to split where the subsequent arm locks into place.  CAUTION:  Use two people to hold the extended arms suspended while placing the net in place.  We found that a small hose clamp restored the structural strength of the damaged arm (see pics).
Conclusion:  The wonderfully innovated deployment and storage of these orange net arms should be its greatest hallmark, unfortunately; it is the only shortcoming of the system as its because the quality of these arms could NOT be made any cheaper. 
    I recommend this item overall, with the caveat of buyer beware. not big enough always falling while wind"

This Complete Croquet Set with Carrying Case by Trademark Games is a must for someone that wants to entertain guests in the backyard.  I was very pleased with the set I purchased. Be aware, at first glance the picture looks like there is a stand. There is not. I also remember as a kid how cool the wooden balls were. However I am now 70 so that was a long time ago. I realize the cost of using wooden balls and having a great stand is why some of the sets cost so much more than what I paid. I would prefer to have been able to afford a more expensive set that had a stand, and wooden balls. However, I was very pleased with the set I purchased. It will give us many hours of pleasure. I suspect it will not last as many years as the ones with wooden balls would, but the quality is great for the price. bought this as a gift.  Received two yellow balls and no purple ball.  Kind of hard to play 6 people when two of you have the same color ball.  I also wish that the mallets would fit inside the bag without having to be taken apart each time."

It features a patented no-gap enclosure system that interlocks the jump mat and the enclosure net at each of the 56 springs, eliminating potentially dangerous gaps. The durable round trampoline framework is made of weather- and rust-resistant galvanized steel, providing extra protection for years to come. It includes T-socket reinforcements to strengthen and increase the frame stability. This blue trampoline offers year-round outdoor excitement that even smaller jumpers will enjoy. The enclosure net features a dual zipper and latch clip closure to help keep little ones safely contained inside. The incorporation of the extra-thick spring pad and UV-protected jump mat makes the Skywalker 8' Trampoline with Safety Enclosure a fun pad for the whole family. We set this up in our basement with average ceilings. Our 5 year old is well away from the ceiling when bouncing.. it does take up most of the room we have it in. Assemble took some man muscle with the springs.
Trampoline is built like its full-sized, just scaled down to 8 ft. Sturdy construction.
ALERT: Positioning of the trampoline on the frame is specific because of the enclosure. We had to tear down and redo the trampoline because the enclosure attaches at specific points on the support arms. We blamed it on the instructions but it was late and common sense was low. The padding came with a rip!  Kid hasn't even jumped on it. Pretty annoying that I'm going to have to sew it before rain gets inside. Or duct tape it. Imagine duct tape on a brand me trampoline! Also, the instructions say you're allowed to take a snack break - I took two."

I bought this Trampoline for myself and I am 6ft and 168 pounds. I use it for bouncing, which keeps my body limber. I recommend this trampoline, since its inexpensive and not too big. I lay on it and still have a lot of head room, as well as foot space. I cover the trampoline with a 12' tarp when I am not using it, since it is sitting out in the hot sun all day!

This blue trampoline features compact dimensions, so you can store it away when not in use. It's small enough to slide under beds or fit in a closet, allowing for easier organization in small spaces. Love it. Its perfect, I'm old and I like that it is not hard in middle. Gives me a nice bounce when I jog on it. The size is great. It takes 3 people to put  together.  It is very very easy,  but you need the strength to do it. Definitely not a one person job. Item was in a damaged condition. You could even see the tools through the plastic were in a damaged condition. The box it came in was dirty and with wholes and markings. People these days have become too comfortable with just throwing anything together in any condition and expecting you to pay for it. I would even want it if it was given to me for free."

The cover that goes over the ""springs"" isn't as necessary since they aren't metal and not much space between them. However it does serve a function. Small feet could still fall/slip between them if the cover isn't there. The cover that comes with it is not the best. It doesn't stay on and easily slips off. We zip-tied it in several places. It still tried to come of where we didn't zip it. 

It's entirely possible we installed the cover incorrectly. There were not specific instructions on how to install this part. I was so excited for this little trampoline.  It is awesome but it seems like I received some incorrect parts, which render it to wobble when you bounce-which is pretty scary.

The leg pieces have two different types but not enough of either for all of the legs to have the same cover.  Which leaves them at different elevations."

My husband and I really struggled to put this together. The pictures are not super clear on the instruction manual. So overall yes great trampoline however if I was buying a trampoline again I would get a trampoline with quails Not great for outside, legs dig into the ground and then you lose the caps. Then it digs into the ground way easier as the cap at least covered the sharp edges of the metal pipe.

It's also now rotted so outside I got about 6 months of use and spent $30 on new ""feet"" to keep it from digging into the ground.

I paid $30 for the item and now it's over twice the price..."

It features a patented no-gap enclosure system that interlocks the jump mat and the enclosure net at each of the 56 springs, eliminating potentially dangerous gaps. The durable round trampoline framework is made of weather- and rust-resistant galvanized steel, providing extra protection for years to come. It includes T-socket reinforcements to strengthen and increase the frame stability. This blue trampoline offers year-round outdoor excitement that even smaller jumpers will enjoy. The enclosure net features a dual zipper and latch clip closure to help keep little ones safely contained inside. The incorporation of the extra-thick spring pad and UV-protected jump mat makes the Skywalker 8' Trampoline with Safety Enclosure a fun pad for the whole family. We set this up in our basement with average ceilings. Our 5 year old is well away from the ceiling when bouncing.. it does take up most of the room we have it in. Assemble took some man muscle with the springs.
Trampoline is built like its full-sized, just scaled down to 8 ft. Sturdy construction.
ALERT: Positioning of the trampoline on the frame is specific because of the enclosure. We had to tear down and redo the trampoline because the enclosure attaches at specific points on the support arms. We blamed it on the instructions but it was late and common sense was low. The padding came with a rip!  Kid hasn't even jumped on it. Pretty annoying that I'm going to have to sew it before rain gets inside. Or duct tape it. Imagine duct tape on a brand me trampoline! Also, the instructions say you're allowed to take a snack break - I took two."

She talks really well for her age and when asked ""What did you do on your birthday?"" Excitedly responds, ""Jumped on my Trampoline!"" 

The toy was more simple to assemble than I expected, but I do suggest you find a quiet, spacious area where you can spread out all the pieces and keep the tiny pieces close. 

We hope you enjoy this Trampoline as much as we do!!! Not super sturdy. Not easy to assemble as the pieces didn't fit right. Paint chipped a gazillion times and came with many dents but child does enjoy it. Not sure if I'd recommend... I'm on the fence."

COntains supplies to create four Face Masks, with a pocket to insert a filter. Kit includes: 8 pre-cut cotton fabrics in assorted colors and patterns, filter material, and elastic for 4 masks. Also includes pattern/instructions and YouTube tutorial link. This face mask kit comes with eight squares of 100% cotton fabric, filter material, elastic and instructions. You definitely need to use an iron to make creases to achieve professional results. The instructions are well written but I watched the YouTube tutorial before I made mine. The video is very helpful. For my first mask, I followed the instructions exactly as I watched in the video. I was very happy with the end result. Now, you'll notice that one of my masks looks a little different than the other three. That's because after successfully making the first one, I didn't think I needed to refer to the instructions again. That was a mistake. When I turned the 2nd mask right side out, I realized I had made an error but I had already stitched around the edges twice so I didn't want to take it all apart. I believe the wonky mask will still work as is. I referred back to the instructions after that...lol. The 3rd and 4th masks turned out perfect. I used 7 inches of elastic for my ear bands. I have a small face. I'm also planning to use filter squares inside the mask. It's nice to have the option of two different sides of color for each mask. My kit came with fabrics that had feminine patterns and colors for three masks and one set of squares was a more masculine navy blue and a blue/white pattern on the other side. I sent my brother a picture of the blue mask, and he liked it so I'll share that mask with him. This was an easy, fun project. I made this item today by watching the video on ""you tube"". I'm not a seamstress but I do know my way around a sewing machine and pattern. The video was very easy to follow but the masks are tedious to do, the material is very thin and the supposed ""filter"" is ridiculous. 
 Once made this item did not fit me. I have small ears and the elastic kept pulling my ears forward and rolling off. I had my daughter try it also and the same thing happened to her. She did say (before the elastic rolled off her ears) they were comfortable and is large enough to cover your nose and under your chin but that is where the ""good"" ends with this product. With the flimsy material they call a ""filter"" I see minimal protection from any germs or viruses. 
 Once the filter was in place I spread the mask out to use it, but when I tried to close or flatten the mask back up the filter did not flatten with it. It bunched up inside the mask so you had to go inside with your fingers (through the open hole) and straighten it out for it to lie flat. 
 I'm not saying this item would not work for another person with larger ears but if you have smaller ears I don't see it working very well and if you have to reach inside the mask to flatten the filter then it really isn't working for you is it? 
 I can not in good conscience recommend this item as a barrier to germs and viruses. I would suggest you look elsewhere."

My boobs are too big and the tape just isn't strong enough. It was very easy to apply but it fell off pretty quickly. I would recommend for people with smaller boobs"

COntains supplies to create four Face Masks, with a pocket to insert a filter. Kit includes: 8 pre-cut cotton fabrics in assorted colors and patterns, filter material, and elastic for 4 masks. Also includes pattern/instructions and YouTube tutorial link. This face mask kit comes with eight squares of 100% cotton fabric, filter material, elastic and instructions. You definitely need to use an iron to make creases to achieve professional results. The instructions are well written but I watched the YouTube tutorial before I made mine. The video is very helpful. For my first mask, I followed the instructions exactly as I watched in the video. I was very happy with the end result. Now, you'll notice that one of my masks looks a little different than the other three. That's because after successfully making the first one, I didn't think I needed to refer to the instructions again. That was a mistake. When I turned the 2nd mask right side out, I realized I had made an error but I had already stitched around the edges twice so I didn't want to take it all apart. I believe the wonky mask will still work as is. I referred back to the instructions after that...lol. The 3rd and 4th masks turned out perfect. I used 7 inches of elastic for my ear bands. I have a small face. I'm also planning to use filter squares inside the mask. It's nice to have the option of two different sides of color for each mask. My kit came with fabrics that had feminine patterns and colors for three masks and one set of squares was a more masculine navy blue and a blue/white pattern on the other side. I sent my brother a picture of the blue mask, and he liked it so I'll share that mask with him. This was an easy, fun project. I made this item today by watching the video on ""you tube"". I'm not a seamstress but I do know my way around a sewing machine and pattern. The video was very easy to follow but the masks are tedious to do, the material is very thin and the supposed ""filter"" is ridiculous. 
 Once made this item did not fit me. I have small ears and the elastic kept pulling my ears forward and rolling off. I had my daughter try it also and the same thing happened to her. She did say (before the elastic rolled off her ears) they were comfortable and is large enough to cover your nose and under your chin but that is where the ""good"" ends with this product. With the flimsy material they call a ""filter"" I see minimal protection from any germs or viruses. 
 Once the filter was in place I spread the mask out to use it, but when I tried to close or flatten the mask back up the filter did not flatten with it. It bunched up inside the mask so you had to go inside with your fingers (through the open hole) and straighten it out for it to lie flat. 
 I'm not saying this item would not work for another person with larger ears but if you have smaller ears I don't see it working very well and if you have to reach inside the mask to flatten the filter then it really isn't working for you is it? 
 I can not in good conscience recommend this item as a barrier to germs and viruses. I would suggest you look elsewhere."

It's available with 36 strips in the pack, offering plenty to work with. Its compact size allows for precision placement. This dress and lingerie tape is simple to apply, so you can be ready to go right away. It will make a helpful addition to your wardrobe. I was a bit hesitant to try these strips after I received them from 3M to try for free. I thought that I, as a mom, whose wardrobe consists of mostly tank tops and shorts would not find a use for these, I was completely wrong! These are amazing! Even with tank tops these strips are amazing to use! Easy to apply and the adhesive was wrong throughout the entire day! I used to keep my shirt in place from being pulled down when my little ones are needing me throughout the day. I also was excited to find that I was now able to wear some of my v-neck shirts without exposing myself and regained some of my wardrobe back! These nice enough to keep in your purse so that you can have them incase of any unexpected problems with the wardrobe on the go! They are easy to apply and you don't have to fight with the paper that is attached to the adhesive. They are completely useful and have now become a staple in my purse. They are also helpful to use with my husband and my little boys when issues have arisen! This is my new favorite product of this year! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I found that product was at times difficult to use especially if you were trying to keep your bra strap showing on certain shirts.  I had many tries with many ending up more of them sticking to my fingers and not the cloth. I did not have a hem that needed to be held up so i can't comment on that use but I wouldn't bother to purchase this produst.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Pair with a Crayola coloring book for a great gift for girls and boys. Safe and nontoxic, ideal for children ages 4 and up. I love the colors, even the new ones. 120 is plenty too choose from. I have always loved Crayola crayons. As a little girl I would get so excited about my new box of 8 crayons, then the 64 count, then the 96 count, now it is 120 count I am one happy adult. I have to say that, when I received them, I was pretty happy. Even if they come in two boxes of 48 and one of 24, all colors are different. I am not quite sure why other reviewers say some colors are the same, they even have different names! Only one white, only one black, silver, gold... Nice.
The problem came with the use. Five minutes of kids between 6 and 8 coloring and several had broken. I was controlling them and there was no misuse, they were coloring normally and several just broke between their fingers! Fingers that, by the way, were stained where they touched the crayon instead of the paper covering it. After 15 minutes of use, the crayons looked like they had been used for weeks, the material is too soft and weak. Price was great but this is not even dollar store quality, it is worse."

Word of advice: If you are someone who can't stand strong smells then it is advised that you treat the affected areas while there is no one home because it is strong (which is why rats can't stand it and leave) Not like any other Natural Peppermint that i have bought in thw past.. Not a good smell"

It is so easy to use, plus no loud noises from a plug in dehumidifier! You just open and pour the crystal mixture into the top of the receptacle, put the lid back on and set it where you need it. The crystals absorb the moisture in the air and when the crystals harden and forms a liquid that drips to the bottom of the receptacle, you dump out into your toilet and flush away. After the crystals are all dissolved, you replace with new ones. It is septic safe and I like that I can't smell any mustiness.

Without using electricity, DampRid crystals absorb excess moisture to create and maintain optimal humidity levels wherever moisture is a problem in the home or office. To use, simply insert an unwrapped tab into the top container. When the bottom container is full and the tab has dissolved, pour out the water and insert a refill tab (sold separately). Each tab lasts 60 days depending on temperature and humidity and will begin working as soon as it is unwrapped! DampRid is ideal for use in the basement, closet, bathroom, laundry room, or storage area – anywhere damp air is a problem. Not for use in moving vehicles. Keep out of reach of children. Read and follow all label directions. But it really does work! The bathroom gets very steamy and it's worked out well in there. 
I struggled with where to place it and finally settled on keeping it on the ground. 
Assembly was very easy! Enjoyed the fresh scent tab. 
And I'll be picking another one up for the closet. If you can get past the smell without having a nosebleed...... the tablets while working turn into stone-like formations like a in a cave, which completely blocks the drain and the water receptacle - causing it to overflow. You then have viscous, terrible smelling, nosebleed causing fumes while you're trying to get the spilled water out of the carpet or the wood or the clothes or off the floor. this is by far the worst product I have ever bought"

I have been using the smaller version of this product for a couple of years in my basement game room. To see this in a “mega” size is great. Having used a dehumidifier that you had to plug in and then empty every time you turned around, this product is a welcome change. It is so easy to use, plus no loud noises from a plug in dehumidifier! You just open and pour the crystal mixture into the top of the receptacle, put the lid back on and set it where you need it. The crystals absorb the moisture in the air and when the crystals harden and forms a liquid that drips to the bottom of the receptacle, you dump out into your toilet and flush away. After the crystals are all dissolved, you replace with new ones. It is septic safe and I like that I can't smell any mustiness. This should last at least 6 months depending on the dampness of your area. The DampRid did not have the tray to put the crystals in. The lid was not taped closed and it must have been lost in the warehouse.  I cannot even use it."

I havenât played pokemon since all the pixelated rpg versions so I really love the idea of the 3D open world aspect of it. The character customization is nice and I love all the skill effects used in the game. Iâve seen people complain about their favorite pokemon not being in it or about the gigantimax pokemon. Iâm not sure why though because I like the new pokemon and the gigantimax feature theyâve added. The seller sent me a UK region version of the game instead of a USA version. Since the switch is region free it doesn't matter as far as the cartridge goes, but when the new DLC content comes out next month it will cause an issue with me being in the United States and the game being a European version."

The Complete Edition contains every piece of downloadable content released for the game, including two massive story expansions: Hearts of Stone &amp; Blood and Wine. It's the perfect opportunity to enter this world for the first time or relive the adventure on the go</p> I have owned Witcher 3 on PC and have played it enough to understand the difference between the original game and the port for the switch. The game deserves to be ranked as both a port and for its content. 

Game: This is THE best rpg that has ever been written for a modern system. The quests feel real. Your decisions have weight and the voice acting is incredible. I love other rpgs (skyrim, divinity, final fantasy etc) but Witcher just manages to go miles above in many categories. The art of the game is downright immersive. The character models look like real people. The only downside is the combat is fairly tricky and can feel clunky sometimes.

Port: First, the packaging is excellent for a switch game. My game came with a thank you letter, stickers, a little compendium and a map. If I am going to buy a 4 year old game at near full price, this is exactly what I want to come with the box. The second thing I noticed was that there is no day 1 patch. The whole game runs of the cart. This is great for someone without access to a fast internet connection and shows the time and care CDPR took in making this edition. Graphics have been downgraded from my PC version. Instead of a crisp dream, it reminds me of an impressionist painting. Absolutely playable but a change none-the-less. Framerate is good and colors pop. Sound is compressed but I didn't notice any large difference. Controls feel sharp. The biggest change is playing it on the go and how convenient that feels. I think that Saber Interactive absolutely hit the technicals out of the park when porting this.

Bottom line: If you liked Breath of the Wild and own a switch, you need to buy, rent or find some way to get your hands on this game. This is by far the worst port on the Switch. This game is so flawed it is impossible to enjoy it. The graphics are ugly, has bad lighting effects and over saturated colors, there are pop-ins regularly (sometimes not even part of the scene, just random graphic glitches), stretching and distorted models when you cut of enemy's limbs - they will shake around and stretch out into infinity), NPCs and horses clipping thru the world, load screens and menus with no images - just a green screen, long load times, frame rate issues, unresponsive controls, clumsy mechanics, a mediocre story, poor voice acting, mini map gps and way points are useless, the horse is uncontrollable and the pathing is awful, and the menu is super slow (it takes 5.5 seconds to move something from your inventory to your storage [and vice versa] - I timed it multiple times). I can't believe that anyone would find this port acceptable in any way. It is highly advised that you stay away from this game. It is a complete waste of money."

The graphics was great,I can give them five stars for that,but this is not why I gave it two stars.The reason why is Activaion's dirty little trick.You get part of the game,in order to get the full game,you need the internet.And you need an internet plan that has more then 10GB for 10GB is what you need to take out of your 20 or 50GB internet plan.Very misleading they sell you a game that has a few stages on it,then expect ppl to download the rest."

My wive loves the retro references and the style closer to the original Paper Mario.  She loves the exploration.  The battles are very different and you have to match up patterns and create an attack path.  This frustrated her to death at first, not being math or process oriented but she is picking it up and is starting to like the battles more.  
We are not done yet but so far it is great!  It can be frustrating when the attacks leave you with little or no complete attack options.  But I enjoy the patterns and planning out Mario's path for the attack.
We recommend it for families of all ages.
The trick is to read the scroll out load.  To hear the way they say things that way is great!  But it is very much cut scenes and scrolls like the original. I hate this paper mario. I cant stand playing it. The worst part is when you go into the battle ring that you have to rearrange the enemies. It makes me want to completely avoid them.

The all new Custom Character Variations give you unprecedented control to customize the fighters and make them your own. The new graphics engine showcasing every skull-shattering, eye-popping moment, brings you so close to the fight you can feel it. And featuring a roster of new and returning Klassic Fighters, Mortal Kombats best in class cinematic story mode continues the epic saga over 25 years in the making.</p> If you like Mortal Kombat then you will love this game.  It would have gotten a 5 star rating, but the load times are too long.  Once you get going its a fun, action-packed fighting game. the justification for the poor graphics quality was to keep the game at a consistent 60fps. They failed to execute this on a good chunk of the actual game. 

The patches are delayed from other consoles. 

Constant crashes make it hard to enjoy for long periods. I've had the game crash each time I go into the Krypt (the game's unlocking feature for gear and items) and it crashes during gear swapping for character customization. It has also crashed on Towers resulting in a loss of consumable items used on the tower. 

The online works and that's it's only redeeming quality. But, again, it's rare that you get a consistent 60fps due to the background stuff going on in the different fight arenas."

You can neither battle wild Pokemon nor re-fight trainers and to level up you now must rely on limited trainer fights or tediously catching Pokemon (which both level the whole team) the problem with leveling by catching (other than the fact that while i haven't been playing long i just know it's going to get old FAST) you are going to end up with relatively limited funds especially in the early parts of the game. I suppose you cold sell the items that your Pokemon finds but still... major flaws if your expecting a cute remake of your childhood game."

Now, here are some things... this unit does not come with the riser to make it taller, you can buy the riser from the arcade 1up website. This unit was very easy and simple to put together - the instructions were very clear. Couple of things on that.... when it comes to the deck that the joystick sits on, there is a sticker that says to remove the film from BOTH sides - this means that clear plastic that goes on top of the deck. Yes there is film on both sides but it isnt obvious. If the cover is not completely crystal clear, then you left the film on one side. Also, the only difficulty I had was attaching the back cover, strangely enough. It was simple, but because of the screws it didnt want to go in. Use different (smaller) screws. And one last thing - when you first turn it on, it takes a minute before the screen goes on, so dont panic like I did lol.  This unit is NOT heavy so please do yourself a big favor and attach it to the wall with the provided hardware. I did not receive the Xbox game that was supposed to come with it.  The associate at the store told me it was still in transit which I found out was not the case.  The store manager was supposed to reach out to me about this but that never happened either.  On the bright side the online rep did do a good job of making things right."

It's been quite the adventure through all this time. Throughout this time, I've concluded that the concept of the game is amazing, along with the graphics, and most of the design.

However, the development team aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. They're late on deadlines, they have a hard time fixing bugs, but they eventually get the job done. I have roughly 4,400 hours into the game in counting, and don't regret a single second of it.

ARK is a great game, and I would recommend giving it a try. Odd, my highly detailed negative review is no longer here. 

This game is a huge time sink with developers who constantly take what people enjoy out of the game, don't communicate, never hit their deadlines, and ban people who speak out from their forums. Avoid it."

Anyone who played the DLC content for how Ellie became bitten in the first place was not surprised at the beginning of the game. And to get all been out of shape because of a belief or decision that another person makes any game is stupid because those same beliefs and choices are made in the real world, and this game series has focused on realistic emotions and feelings that the characters go through. That there's two sides to every conflict, and that maybe the people whom we think are evil is a victim themselves and is also after a form of justice. I managed to go into this game completely spoiler-free, and can say honestly, it is one of the best games I've ever played. I may not agree with certain decisions and choices in the game, but it's not about me, it's about what the characters are deciding to do and for us to see it through. The game truly is a masterpiece and tells next story of human  emotion and survival in the worst of situations. We all waited a long tie for this game to come out. The Last of Us was an awesome game one of our favorites. We were extremely excited to get it when it came. What a disappointment. killing off Joel was a huge mistake and then having to play as Abby when you just wanted her dead. Ruined for me!!"

What will Sam discover on the road ahead A genre defining gameplay experience holds these answers and more.""--provided by Metacritic.com.</p> This game, Is by far, the most interesting game I have played in a long time. All games shouldn't be about who can kill the most or nonstop insane action, and anyone who has ever played one of Kojima's games, know he tells a story and makes a game around that, the exception being MGS5, greatest game never finished. I found myself wanting to complete every area fully before I would move one, I wanted to explore this world his team made. I loved how the game slowly explained this crazy world you found yourself in, yet treated your character like he knew the info, because he already has been living there, making you put together  what everything was little by little. Is this game for everyone? Not at all, But for gamers who like to lose themselves every now and again in a story that would make an amazing novel, or visuals that would even make an exciting and dramatic movie, then you have to try it , and see how the Death Stranding can connect us all. If you want to waste hours of your life this game is for you. Starts off to make you think its goin  to be a good game and story. Been playing this for about 3 hours a day for a week and you make no progress. Your a mail man delivering things back and forth to the same places. Absoulsute waste of money do not buy. Dont listen to all the good reveiws like i did. They must be getting paid a furtune to say they like this game. Im a real person bought this game not getting paid to write a reveiw.

The Complete Edition contains every piece of downloadable content released for the game, including two massive story expansions: Hearts of Stone &amp; Blood and Wine. It's the perfect opportunity to enter this world for the first time or relive the adventure on the go</p> I have owned Witcher 3 on PC and have played it enough to understand the difference between the original game and the port for the switch. The game deserves to be ranked as both a port and for its content. 

Game: This is THE best rpg that has ever been written for a modern system. The quests feel real. Your decisions have weight and the voice acting is incredible. I love other rpgs (skyrim, divinity, final fantasy etc) but Witcher just manages to go miles above in many categories. The art of the game is downright immersive. The character models look like real people. The only downside is the combat is fairly tricky and can feel clunky sometimes.

Port: First, the packaging is excellent for a switch game. My game came with a thank you letter, stickers, a little compendium and a map. If I am going to buy a 4 year old game at near full price, this is exactly what I want to come with the box. The second thing I noticed was that there is no day 1 patch. The whole game runs of the cart. This is great for someone without access to a fast internet connection and shows the time and care CDPR took in making this edition. Graphics have been downgraded from my PC version. Instead of a crisp dream, it reminds me of an impressionist painting. Absolutely playable but a change none-the-less. Framerate is good and colors pop. Sound is compressed but I didn't notice any large difference. Controls feel sharp. The biggest change is playing it on the go and how convenient that feels. I think that Saber Interactive absolutely hit the technicals out of the park when porting this.

Bottom line: If you liked Breath of the Wild and own a switch, you need to buy, rent or find some way to get your hands on this game. This is by far the worst port on the Switch. This game is so flawed it is impossible to enjoy it. The graphics are ugly, has bad lighting effects and over saturated colors, there are pop-ins regularly (sometimes not even part of the scene, just random graphic glitches), stretching and distorted models when you cut of enemy's limbs - they will shake around and stretch out into infinity), NPCs and horses clipping thru the world, load screens and menus with no images - just a green screen, long load times, frame rate issues, unresponsive controls, clumsy mechanics, a mediocre story, poor voice acting, mini map gps and way points are useless, the horse is uncontrollable and the pathing is awful, and the menu is super slow (it takes 5.5 seconds to move something from your inventory to your storage [and vice versa] - I timed it multiple times). I can't believe that anyone would find this port acceptable in any way. It is highly advised that you stay away from this game. It is a complete waste of money."

For only a little over $30, it's totally worth it! Definitely brought back a lot of childhood memories! The graphics was great,I can give them five stars for that,but this is not why I gave it two stars.The reason why is Activaion's dirty little trick.You get part of the game,in order to get the full game,you need the internet.And you need an internet plan that has more then 10GB for 10GB is what you need to take out of your 20 or 50GB internet plan.Very misleading they sell you a game that has a few stages on it,then expect ppl to download the rest."

My wive loves the retro references and the style closer to the original Paper Mario.  She loves the exploration.  The battles are very different and you have to match up patterns and create an attack path.  This frustrated her to death at first, not being math or process oriented but she is picking it up and is starting to like the battles more.  
We are not done yet but so far it is great!  It can be frustrating when the attacks leave you with little or no complete attack options.  But I enjoy the patterns and planning out Mario's path for the attack.
We recommend it for families of all ages.
The trick is to read the scroll out load.  To hear the way they say things that way is great!  But it is very much cut scenes and scrolls like the original. I hate this paper mario. I cant stand playing it. The worst part is when you go into the battle ring that you have to rearrange the enemies. It makes me want to completely avoid them. I have no ideal how this game has good reviews. How can anybody like this. i pretty much hate everything about this game. Its no fun playing the game at all for me. I can wait to get rid of it"

The all new Custom Character Variations give you unprecedented control to customize the fighters and make them your own.

And featuring a roster of new and returning Klassic Fighters, Mortal Kombats best in class cinematic story mode continues the epic saga over 25 years in the making.</p> If you like Mortal Kombat then you will love this game.  It would have gotten a 5 star rating, but the load times are too long.  Once you get going its a fun, action-packed fighting game. the justification for the poor graphics quality was to keep the game at a consistent 60fps. They failed to execute this on a good chunk of the actual game. 

The patches are delayed from other consoles. 

Constant crashes make it hard to enjoy for long periods. I've had the game crash each time I go into the Krypt (the game's unlocking feature for gear and items) and it crashes during gear swapping for character customization. It has also crashed on Towers resulting in a loss of consumable items used on the tower. 

The online works and that's it's only redeeming quality. But, again, it's rare that you get a consistent 60fps due to the background stuff going on in the different fight arenas."

You can neither battle wild Pokemon nor re-fight trainers and to level up you now must rely on limited trainer fights or tediously catching Pokemon (which both level the whole team) the problem with leveling by catching (other than the fact that while i haven't been playing long i just know it's going to get old FAST) you are going to end up with relatively limited funds especially in the early parts of the game.

Now, here are some things... this unit does not come with the riser to make it taller, you can buy the riser from the arcade 1up website. This unit was very easy and simple to put together - the instructions were very clear. Couple of things on that.... when it comes to the deck that the joystick sits on, there is a sticker that says to remove the film from BOTH sides - this means that clear plastic that goes on top of the deck. Yes there is film on both sides but it isnt obvious. If the cover is not completely crystal clear, then you left the film on one side. Also, the only difficulty I had was attaching the back cover, strangely enough. It was simple, but because of the screws it didnt want to go in. Use different (smaller) screws. And one last thing - when you first turn it on, it takes a minute before the screen goes on, so dont panic like I did lol.  This unit is NOT heavy so please do yourself a big favor and attach it to the wall with the provided hardware. I did not receive the Xbox game that was supposed to come with it.  The associate at the store told me it was still in transit which I found out was not the case.  The store manager was supposed to reach out to me about this but that never happened either.  On the bright side the online rep did do a good job of making things right."

It has play now for the NBA and WNBA for people that want to play a quick game with either your friend or against a computer. Its most popular mode is MyCareer which allows you to create a player and go through a storyline while playing in the NBA. You can get endorsements and also gain fans.

Another mode is MyLeague which lets you be the GM of an NBA and try to get your team to win the championship.

It is surprisingly relaxing to play. I enjoyed playing it in Japanese spoken language with English subtitles, something that is optional. It has a camera mode that you can quickly get in/out. I found myself snapping pictures (something I don't ever do) at SO many points because it is just beautiful lol. I recommend playing with a PS4 PRO to get the most out of this game. If you have a 4K HDR tv then you will be BLOWN away by the graphics. Im not a big open world games BUT this game isn't filled with your typical fetch quests mission but filled with compelling content, with progressive skill trees, customizable gear and lots of collectables if you choose. Ive also seen a lot of reviews that state how difficult the game was so I went into it thinking it was going to be hard ...and its not really. I wish I started on the hardest difficulty, but I played it on normal. It's not a button masher at all. It has different fighting stances that you change up on the fly during battles and plenty of stealth mission. The fight style it closely resembles is Assassins Creed. If I were to criticize it in one way, it needs improvement with the camera system and should snap behind your player. Once you get the hang of how to fight and use the camera, it gets easy. This game it's bad. During all the game the enemies are soooo EASY, that's some times it's boring. But i still playing hopping they would get harder. But then I faced Ryuzo, that was a Game Over. I lost against Ryuzo over 50 times and I gave up! Ryuzo killed me with 3 hits ONLY! even when my suit was upgraded to the top, and Ryuzo dodged almost 90% of all my hits and every  hit was reducing almost nothing when my sword was upgraded to the end. I tried to dodge their attack and he updated their hit to match my dodge movement every time . Ryuzo = Game Over, good look"

Anyone who played the DLC content for how Ellie became bitten in the first place was not surprised at the beginning of the game. And to get all been out of shape because of a belief or decision that another person makes any game is stupid because those same beliefs and choices are made in the real world, and this game series has focused on realistic emotions and feelings that the characters go through. That there's two sides to every conflict, and that maybe the people whom we think are evil is a victim themselves and is also after a form of justice. I managed to go into this game completely spoiler-free, and can say honestly, it is one of the best games I've ever played. I may not agree with certain decisions and choices in the game, but it's not about me, it's about what the characters are deciding to do and for us to see it through. The game truly is a masterpiece and tells next story of human  emotion and survival in the worst of situations. We all waited a long tie for this game to come out. The Last of Us was an awesome game one of our favorites. We were extremely excited to get it when it came. What a disappointment. killing off Joel was a huge mistake and then having to play as Abby when you just wanted her dead. Ruined for me!!"

The Oculus Rift S provides the ULTIMATE gaming experience. Yes, you will need a medium - high performing PC to see the benefits; however, this provides much better graphics and more gaming options compared to the Oculus Quest. I have gotten two Oculus Rift S from Walmart. The first had a defect with the lens and so Walmart replaced that with another Oculus. The second one has a defect with the headband. I know they say third times the charm but I'm gonna try a different store and hope that their stock is better."

This product is definitely something I would consider absolutely dreadful only when you compare it to other VR products because on it's own. It's okay? The biggest issues you'll find will be in the tracking. In order for this to work right you will need a well lit room and PLENTY of things lying around to be used as ""landmarks"" for the trackers, if anything falls short of this, it will be a borderline unusable experience. I would strongly recommend either a Rift S for entry level VR or a Valve Index for Enthusiast grade. All in all, there are much better options available."

The Step2 sports climber teaches children important hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills from a young age that will transfer over to other activities as they continue to grow. This item offers something for every one and is an excellent way to keep multiple children occupied at once. They can kick around the soccer ball, toss the football around or shoot hoops while yet another child takes a ride down the climber slide with the built-in steps. This set provides a safe and easy challenge for children and can be used both indoors and out.</p> We bought this as a birthday present for our soon to be one year old.  We set it up when it came which was simple and our boy uses it with our assistance.  We set it up in his playroom and we both probably get more use out of it than he does mostly because it's fun to shoot hoops when he is playing with a toy nearby.  This is something he will grow into for sure and good use out of.  He smiles watching us shoot baskets and he has even tried to dunk a couple of times.  Fun stuff.  Good memories to come! This looks cute but be aware it requires a 4"" piece of wood to put together. If you're like me you don't have random blocks of wood at your house. Also the balls require a pump, not included. Other than that it's an okay product."

It's super fast right out of the box. Harder to put together than I expected but not difficult. I needed my husbands help. Due to the virus and living with crap weather we have it indoors. It's big but really the best value for the money. My almost 7 year old niece was loving it too. This item was packaged by the manufacture with two right-side base supports, instead of one left and one right, which means it could not be assembled for safe use. This is a quality control problem with the manufacture, it is not Walmart's fault. But, I have to return to Walmart for refund.

Little handy boys and girls can use their tool workshop to pretend to fix up the house. This kid's workshop can help develop fine motors skills as children play with the drill, saw and hammer. Plus, it will keep little imaginations busy for hours! Adult assembly required. This is a nice toy for toddlers ages 3-5 years old. I found it was the perfect height for my son. This is a nice size toy that won't take up too much room but does fit nicely up against a wall in their bedroom or toy area. I do like that that this toy comes with a lot of storage for other toys. My son started to use the workbench as a place to pretend fix his race cars. He loves putting together the fake wood truck and also using the work light. This has kept him busy for hours. He loves that he can build things just like mom and dad who have been doing some home improvement projects around the home. Beside the work light one of his favorites is the power drill and he loves that it can work both forward and backwards. 
As much as I love this product and so does my son, I could only give it a 4 star rating. The reason being is that it wasn't very easy to put together. While the directions don't call for an electric drill, I would recommend it. Trying to build this with just a regular screwdriver I found very difficult especially if you are trying to build this yourself. Some of the holes were not lining up correctly. I would also suggest having someone help you build this. Another thing I was not a fan of was the directions not in color. I feel having these in color would help make sure you have the correct piece and making sure that it is facing the right way. 
One of the other great features with this toy is the foam fake wood truck that you could build. I did find this a little more advance when it comes to building it. That a 3-5 year old wouldn't really get it. It would be nice if another foam fake wood building toy came with this as well. But I did see you can buy extras, which is a great idea for extra gifts to keep the toy fresh for the kids. Thank you Step2 for letting my son test out this toy as part of the Step2 Toy Tester Program! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 3 year old boy and 4 year old girl  was very excited for for a workbench but their excitement quickly faded when the set up took me a bit longer than expected. Here's a setup tip: use a drill, not a screwdriver as shown in the instruction images. After the work bench was constructed I noticed I was missing a few of the toy nuts and bolts and some of the smaller peices. Also, the little orange bucket on the side of the surface kept falling off. 

After hammering and sawing away for about half an hour, they quickly grew bored of the workbench itself and began to “construct” using the toy tools around the house. After a while the noise level in the house really got to me.  After a while they kept asking me to “fix the drill” which seemed defective and stopped working later that very first day. that being said a couple of days later they did return to playing with the workbench but had begun pretending it was a kitchen set. 
 
Summary: the tools are the only things the kids really play with beyond the first couple days. so if your kids have limited play space this workbench is less than ideal. This product would be a lot better if it included something for the kids to use the tools on to “construct” and simulate a building experience. The current “wooden” car is more of a puzzle than anything else and we were not able to fit it together

I like the way it came with little plastic see creatures and a few accessories to use.  So far we have been using it in the house with macaroni and dry things for our 15-month-old to play with.

I bought this at the end of summer unfortunately so unfortunately my daughter didn't get a ton of use out of it, but it was her favorite thing for a few weeks before we had to put it away! I like that there's a spot to put the step2 umbrella in (separate purchase) if someone doesn't have a covered patio. Setting it up took just over 30 minutes so that wasn't too bad. The only thing that annoyed me was the diving board and slide don't stay on properly, and don't ""click"" on. My daughter (23 months) would get a bit frustrated with them constantly falling off. Before next spring/summer I'll be super-glueing them on so there's no issues. Otherwise, there's tons for them to do with this table and provides hours of fun!

It makes a thoughtful gift idea for a birthday, holiday or any other occasion. This is super cute and really well design aesthetically. Would definitely recommend. Three suggestions though I wish the base was better attached to the house, the musical wreath had a on/off button and that the box that is came in was larger so once assembled it could be stored in it. We own multiple Step2 products and this gingerbread house is the only bad one. The house is wobbly in the base. The door doesn’t stay on. The wreath only plays music when moved and some kids don’t understand that and keep trying to push the center thinking there’s a button."

Way too much trouble when you waited on swing to arrive and then you have to call and deal with mfr because parts are missing. They should make sure all is there when shipped. The hardware pkgs had been cut open."

Would warn that we had four adults putting it together and it took over eight hours.  Lots of pieces and parts.  The round slide was the most difficult to put together.  Our two year old loves the slides and swings.  Would recommend Very unhappy!! I decided to order this over other swingsets because I had guaranteed delivery in 2 days to have set up in time for my daughters birthday. I received 4 out of 5 boxes and was told I can only get a refund for just the 5th box not a replacement sent out. Not to mention that 2 days after ordering it its priced at $200 less than I just paid. Still dont have what I need to build it. Will not be buying any other products."
