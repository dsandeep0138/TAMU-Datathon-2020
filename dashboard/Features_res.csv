It features an ergonomic slim handle design for balance and speed. The frictionless smooth rotation of this speed skipping rope ensures faster spins so that you can burn more fat. For incredible cardio workouts, this item is the right choice. It is small and lightweight enough for you to take with you to the park, beach, while on vacation and more. This Athletic Works jump rope helps increase your agility, coordination, and endurance, while maintaining good health. It is ideal for boxers, MMA fighters and other types of athletes and weekend warriors. For the money, five stars. Not to be confused with something that might cost you 100 bucks. But it is adjustable, provided you know what length you are comfortable with. Once you cut it, you cannot redo it. So, measure twice and cut once (or go in increments). Pull the excess thru from the handle end with pliers, and use scissors or a wire cutter. Vinyl rope will last long. Light-weight, good for cardio. Only bought this recently, so I don't know how well the entire construction of the handle and rope will last. But for under 7 bucks, it's a great investment in fitness gear. It is missing a handle. So it is totally useless","[0.12514282483302683, 0.6008597340994989, -0.5400193976565906, -0.5727643510133161, -0.06022376352900622]"

It's easy to use for beginners and professionals. wanted to try something new. heads up though, if you aren't experienced in working out and with strong abdominal muscles, then this probably isn't for you. after putting it together, there are too much free space between the handles so the wheel wobbles a lot.  i had to put a spacer in between the wheels to use it.   should get it from the store so you can inspect it first.","[0.16504984973820974, 0.6804987700709225, -0.02512861241043585, 0.7134737715569681, 0.001923843017900037]"

First let me start by saying as a weary (health/fitness) online shopper I rarely post reviews, but this is a must have item. I've got to say, I LOVE this mat! It's thick so you don't feel the rough ground which is perfect for someone like myself who has had multiple spinal fusions, it provides phenomenal support. Also, it's also not like some cloth mats that attract dirt or worse get drenched in sweat, it also wont move all over the ground making workouts unstable-the material keeps it stable. This mat is similar to ones I would use in the Army for physical fitness training! The built in straps are a huge help for convenience. Honestly the mat would even be great for the beach or camping they are perfect for on the go comfort. I provided some pics and you can see it is good quality material.  (keep in mind i dislocated my wrist just had surgery a few days ago yet I can hold this no problem because it is so lightweight.). Mat is soft and comfortable. I used it once today and it already has large indents on it from doing simple floor exercises like planks. Does not seem that this mat will last very long. (Did not place free weights into the mat, marks are from my heels, elbows and hands)","[0.7474725131683791, -0.12708299729605968, -0.03582640073190755, -0.03385031610778739, 0.6501579646255183]"
